# Day 5: Structured Outputs with Pydantic and TypedDict in Python

## What I Learned

- The difference between Python's `TypedDict` (type hints, no runtime validation) and Pydantic's `BaseModel` (runtime validation, type coercion, and error reporting).
- How to use Pydantic for data validation, default values, optional fields, and type coercion.
- How Pydantic enforces strict types (e.g., string vs. int) and validates formats (e.g., email addresses with `EmailStr`).
- How to debug and interpret Pydantic validation errors.
- The importance of re-running all cells after installing new packages in Jupyter/VS Code notebooks.

## Key Concepts & Demos

### 1. TypedDict (Static Type Hints)
- Used for type hinting dictionaries, but does not enforce types at runtime.
- Example: You can assign a string to an int field and no error is raised.

### 2. Pydantic BaseModel (Runtime Validation)
- Enforces types and validates data at runtime.
- Raises errors for invalid types or formats (e.g., wrong email format).
- Supports default values and optional fields.
- Coerces types when possible (e.g., string to int).

### 3. Pydantic with EmailStr
- Demonstrated how to use `EmailStr` for email validation.
- Shows how invalid emails raise validation errors.

### 4. Common Errors and Debugging
- ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic' â€” fixed by installing pydantic in the notebook environment.
- ValidationError: Raised when data does not match the model's type or format requirements.
- Kernel restarts: Always re-run all cells after installing new packages.

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook `Day05/Structured_outputs/WithStructureLLMs/pydantic-demo.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter.
2. If you see a module error, install pydantic in the notebook environment and restart the kernel.
3. Run all cells from the top to see type validation, coercion, and error handling in action.

## Example Code

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr
from typing import Optional

class Student(BaseModel):
    name: str = "kirtan"
    age: Optional[int] = None
    email: EmailStr

student = Student(email="kirtan@gmail.com")
print(student.name)
print(student.age)
print(student.email)
```

## Troubleshooting
- If you get a module error, install pydantic in the notebook (not just in your system Python).
- If you get a validation error, check your data types and formats.
- Always re-run all cells after installing or updating packages.

This day focused on robust data validation and type safety in Python using Pydantic, and how it compares to static type hints with TypedDict.
