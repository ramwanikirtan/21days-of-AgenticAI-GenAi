# Day 2: Logging in Python

This folder contains my Day 2 project focused on Python logging techniques and best practices.

## What I Learned
- How to use the built-in `logging` module for tracking events and debugging
- Setting up different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Configuring log format and output destinations (console, file)
- Using handlers, formatters, and loggers for flexible logging
- Best practices for logging in real-world Python projects

## Key Techniques
- `logging.basicConfig()` for quick setup
- Creating custom loggers and handlers
- Formatting log messages for clarity
- Rotating log files for large applications

## How to Use
- Explore the scripts in 
this folder to see logging examples
- Run the Python files to observe log outputs in the console and log files

## Resources
- [Python Logging Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)
- [Real Python: Logging](https://realpython.com/python-logging/)
