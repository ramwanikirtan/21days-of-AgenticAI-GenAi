    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project focuses on building a documentation similarity system using LangChain and machine learning techniques. The goal is to compare and retrieve similar documents or text passages based on their semantic meaning, which is useful for search, recommendation, and knowledge management tasks."

    "## Approach and Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Preparation\n",
    "- Collected a set of documents or text passages to be compared.\n",
    "- Preprocessed the text (cleaning, normalization) to ensure consistent input for embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Embedding Generation\n",
    "- Used LangChain's embedding models to convert text into high-dimensional vector representations.\n",
    "- Functions used:\n",
    "  - `from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings, HuggingFaceEmbeddings`\n",
    "  - Initialized the embedding model (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace, or other supported models).\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings\n",
    "    embedder = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\")\n",
    "    vector = embedder.embed_query(\"Sample document text\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- Each document was transformed into a vector using the embedding model."

    "- Applied cosine similarity to measure the closeness between document vectors.\n",
    "- Used scikit-learn's `cosine_similarity` function:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n",
    "  similarity_score = cosine_similarity([vector1], [vector2])[0][0]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Compared the query/document vector with all other document vectors to find the most similar ones."
