# Day 2: Python Logging & Pydantic

This README summarizes everything I learned and practiced on Day 2 of my 21 Days Agentic AI & GenAI Challenge.

## Logging in Python
- Using the built-in `logging` module for tracking events and debugging
- Setting up logging levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Configuring log format and output destinations (console, file)
- Using handlers, formatters, and custom loggers
- Rotating log files for large applications
- Best practices for logging in real-world Python projects

## Pydantic for Data Validation
- Creating models with `BaseModel` for structured and validated data
- Using Python type hints for model fields
- Automatic type validation and error handling
- Adding optional fields with default values
- Building nested models for hierarchical data
- Customizing fields with constraints and descriptions using `Field`
- Comparing dataclasses (no validation) vs. Pydantic models (strict validation)
- Defining list fields and handling type casting
- Generating JSON schema for models

## How to Use
- Explore the `day2/logging` folder for logging examples and scripts
- Explore the `day2/Pydantic` folder and `intro.ipynb` for Pydantic code and explanations

Day 2 helped me master robust logging and data validation techniques for building reliable Python applications.
