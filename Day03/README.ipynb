    "# Day 03: LangChain Deep Dive and Practical Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Personal Note\n",
    "I took a 1-day break before starting Day 3. Instead of jumping straight into coding, I decided to first dive deep into the theory. This helped me build a strong foundation and understand the bigger picture of what I was about to implement. I focused on understanding what LangChain is, its core components, and how they fit together. This approach made me more interested and motivated to learn the practical aspects."

    "  - **Models:** LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, etc.)\n",
    "  - **Prompts:** Templates and prompt engineering\n",
    "  - **Memory:** Storing and recalling information across interactions\n",
    "  - **Agents:** Tools that use LLMs to decide actions\n",
    "  - **Chains:** Sequences of calls (LLMs, tools, etc.)\n",
    "  - **Indexes:** For document retrieval and search"

    "  - Implemented both closed source (OpenAI, Anthropic) and open source (HuggingFace) chat models.\n",
    "  - Compared their outputs and usage patterns.\n",
    "- **Embeddings Models:**\n",
    "  - Experimented with embedding models for text representation.\n",
    "  - Learned about their role in search, retrieval, and similarity tasks.\n",
    "- **Functions and Utilities:**\n",
    "  - Explored various LangChain functions for invoking models, handling outputs, and chaining operations."
